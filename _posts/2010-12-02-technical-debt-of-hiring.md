title: The Technical Debt of Hiring

Resumes suck—and yet we continue to rely on this terrible tool when making difficult and expensive hiring decisions.

Consider the typical hiring workflow:

1. You post a job opening.
2. Your inbox is flooded with applications. The attached resumes are set in a tiny font so as to maximize the amount of information the applicant can throw at you. You have a bad feeling about this.
3. After 5-10 resumes you realize that at the current rate, you’ll be reading resumes until your hair goes gray. You compromise on a quick skimming of the pile, saving time at the expense of thoroughness. Often you discard a CV just because you don’t like the way it looks. The engineer in you is sobbing at the unscientific nature of it all.
4. After chopping down your candidate list, you start a round of phone screens to weed out the incompetent and the bozos. Actual interviews take hours away from your technical team, your goal is to shield them from this sort of distraction.
5. After 5-10 phone screens you realize that at the current rate, you’ll be doing phone screens until your hair goes gray. You compromise and make the phone screen shorter, relying on your instincts to tell you whether somebody seems worthy of an interview. You can’t hear the engineer inside you anymore, and worry that he has committed [seppuku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku).

Sound familiar? The worst part is that we end up compromising at every stage. We let bad candidates move forward and take up more of our precious time because we can’t afford to screen them more carefully. We accrue the [technical debt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) of hiring—and like all debt, eventually we must pay it with interest, usually in the form of wasted interviews.

# Resumes: the Root of the Problem

The ideal resume is a concise introduction for a candidate, and should impart the following information:

* What skills do you possess?
* What experience do you have?
* What makes you awesome? Why would you be a great fit for this job (and our company)?

Unfortunately, this ideal resume is hiding out with unicorns and Santa Claus. I’ve yet to see one that didn’t dilute these essentials; candidates are worried that writing less might leave the impression that there’s less to write about. As a result, resumes are full of buzzwords (“*empowered and innovative individual*”) and practically untestable claims (“*self-starter with ten years of experience solving problems*”). Reading them becomes an exhausting exercise in separating the nuggets of information from the dross.

Resumes contain no direct evidence of skills. You don’t really care about the resume—you want to hire someone *passionate* about their craft, someone with actual domain *expertise*, someone who has fun *learning* the things they don’t already know. You want someone who can communicate ideas clearly and effectively, someone who can make sound decisions based on incomplete information.

Almost every job posting contains some variation of the above, and yet the standard response—a resume—doesn’t tell you what you need to know in order to make a decision. You want the anti-resume: condensed, useful information about these qualities in a prospective hire.

Skills is a tool for identifying expertise and passion in developers. It tests your applicants and delivers beautiful data that helps you decide who to interview. We're building Skills to deal with our own frustrations. We're really excited about it, and we think you will be too.
